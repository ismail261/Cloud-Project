I have used watchdog to monitor changes
in the local folder. Please make sure watch
dog is installed.

To run do the following changes: 

1) Change your app_key and app_secret
2) Change the value for inputFolder. 
   Specify the path from where the file has to be read. 
   Do not change the format.
3) Change the value for outputFolder. 
   Specify the path where the file has to be downloaded. 
   Do not change the format.
4) Change the value for path. 
   Specify the path from where the file has to be read. 
   Do not change the format.
5) Change the value for gpg_home. 
   Specify the path for gpg where all keys would be stored. 
   Do not change the format.
6) open cmd and go to the folder which contains python file.
7) "python project1.py" to execute
